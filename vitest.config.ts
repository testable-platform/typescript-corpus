 * vitest 0.34.6 -- newest supporting Node 16 (>=14.18.0).

 * It runs the SAME spec files as mocha rather than replacing it. Two
 * independent runners over one suite keeps the test suite identical across
 * every Node version in the corpus (the Node 12 repos cannot run vitest at
 * all), and gives coverage a third independent number next to c8 and nyc.
