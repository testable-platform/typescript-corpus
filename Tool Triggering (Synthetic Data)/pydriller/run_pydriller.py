"""pydriller runner -- branch TS-045.

Mines this repository's own history for the three signals the history-tool
family is assigned to produce: churn, change coupling and ownership.

The history is synthetic but structurally real -- see README, "History design".
Ownership is carried in Co-authored-by trailers, so a tool that counts only the
author field will report a single contributor and be wrong.
