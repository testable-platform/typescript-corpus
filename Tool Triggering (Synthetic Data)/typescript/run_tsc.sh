# Resolve the compiler through Node's resolver rather than node_modules/.bin.
#
# node_modules/.bin/tsc is NOT guaranteed to be the typescript this package.json
# pins. @cyclonedx/cdxgen depends on @appthreat/atom-parsetools, which depends on
# @typescript/typescript6, which depends on "@typescript/old": "npm:typescript@^6"
# -- an aliased TypeScript that declares its own `tsc` bin. npm, yarn and pnpm
# give the DIRECT dependency's bin priority; **bun does not**, and links the
# transitive TypeScript 6.0.3 over the declared 5.9.3.
#
# The result is a repo where `require('typescript')` is 5.9.3 (so
# typescript-eslint, ts-morph, madge and ts-node all see 5.9.3) while every shell
# runner that calls .bin/tsc compiles with 6.0.3. Nothing warns. On these repos it
# surfaces as TS5107 (`moduleResolution=node10` is deprecated) -- a diagnostic
# that the declared compiler does not emit at all.
# `paths: [process.cwd()]` is not optional. A bare require.resolve('typescript')
# walks up to the GLOBAL node_modules if the local one is missing or incomplete
# -- and a globally installed TypeScript 6.0.3 will happily answer. That is how
# a branch whose `yarn install` had failed outright still printed
# "[tsc] version: Version 6.0.3" and carried on: the runner reported a compiler
# that was never a dependency of this repo. Resolution must be anchored to the
# project, and the result must be inside it.
